The increasing demand of virtual simulation to assess the safety effects of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving (AD) functions in traffic led to the foundation of the Eclipse Working Group openPASS. The aim is to support the development of Eclipse projects, which provide a software platform that enables the simulation of traffic situations to predict real-world effectiveness of ADAS and AD functions. In short, openPASS specifies an open source platform for a prospective safety assessment of those technologies. Originally, the term “openPASS” formed a backronym for “Open Platform for the Assessment of Safety Systems”, but openPASS has been expanded beyond the limitations of safety systems towards any kind of ADAS and AD functions. Thus, one of the main agreed target objectives is to become a broadly accepted effectiveness assessment platform for ADAS and AD functions. In line with our target objective, as a first step, we aim to develop a trustworthy, reliable and transparent platform.  

The following presentation gives you a [short glance about the idea of openPASS](openpass_at_a_glance.pdf) (4th March 2020).
