## Scope

The Eclipse Working Group openPASS is managing the Eclipse project sim@openPASS.

Eclipse sim@openPASS provides a software platform that enables the simulation of traffic situations to predict the real-world effectiveness of advanced driver assistance systems or automated driving functions.

Safety relevant aspects of traffic, such as infrastructural elements or behavioural characteristics, are investigated with this platform. The platform can run entirely flexible multi-agent simulations which include stochastic variations as well as reproducibility. The flexibility is achieved by outsourcing to dynamic libraries (so called modules) all models defining the traffic scenario or behaviour of traffic participants. Additionally, to the platform, demonstrator modules are provided, which comprise simple traffic situations and behaviours of traffic participants as well as a collision model to answer basic research questions. Furthermore, demonstrator applications will be given to post process the simulation results. sim@openPASS users can incorporate their own developed modules and post processing applications; this allows them to answer a wide variety of their specific research questions. These questions are related to development, testing, and rating of vehicle functions. Possible users can be automotive OEMs, suppliers, public transport authorities, consumer protection organizations, insurance companies, academia, and legislation.

## Timeline

{{< figure class="padding-30" src="/about/timeline.jpg" alt="Timeline of openPASS working group" >}}

The Eclipse Working Group openPASS was founded in August 2016. The idea of openPASS was generated from the initiative P.E.A.R.S. The founding members were BMW Group, Mercedes Benz-AG, ITK Engineering GmbH and Volkswagen Group of America. In January 2018 TÜV SÜD Auto Service GmbH has joined the WG followed by Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) in June and Robert Bosch GmbH in November.

The WG is managing a single project namely sim@openPASS. The initial commit was in March 2017. Since then the open source platform has been developed further and several releases have been published.
