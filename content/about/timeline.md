{{< figure class="padding-30" src="/about/timeline.jpg" alt="Timeline of openPASS working group" >}}

The Eclipse Working Group openPASS was founded in August 2016. The idea of openPASS was generated from the initiative P.E.A.R.S. The founding members were BMW Group, Mercedes Benz-AG, ITK Engineering GmbH and Volkswagen Group of America. In January 2018 TÜV SÜD Auto Service GmbH has joined the WG followed by Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) in June and Robert Bosch GmbH in November.

The WG is managing a single project namely sim@openPASS. The initial commit was in March 2017. Since then the open source platform has been developed further and several releases have been published.
